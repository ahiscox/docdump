<p>
The excerpts should be used as a reference only, their accuracy is
entirely dependent on the Tesseract Optical Character Recognition system
(developed currently by Google). While computer vision technologies have
made great strides, they are still far from perfect.

The excerpt is just a portion of the entire recognized text, it is
just there for convenience. When a search is performed for a document,
the documents recognized text, comments, tags, and optionally date and
time are all searched.
